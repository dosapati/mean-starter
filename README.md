# mean-starter using token-based-auth-backend
========================

MEAN stack starter project using Token Based Authentication Backend Project Written in NodeJS.

> This project doesn't follow `http://mean.io` standard way of creating a project. 

##### I personally prefer to create them clean from scratch and doesn't add up `mean.io` overhead.
